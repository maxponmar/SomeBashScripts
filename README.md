Some bash scripts that help me to do some tasks

# GIT SCRIPTS


1. After you start your project on your machine run:

```gnew```

* This will start a git repository and create an empty file to do the first commit

2. Then create a github repository and run:

```gsync https://github.com/[YOUR_USER]/[YOUR_REPOSITORY].git```

* This is going to link your local repository to your github one

3. Now you repository is ready, at this point whenever you write some code and want yo update your repository run:

```gupdate "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"```

* This is going to update your local repository and commit it (git add .; git commit -m "YOUR_MESSAGE")
